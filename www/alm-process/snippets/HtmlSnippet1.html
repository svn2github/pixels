<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />This project is a home for a set of image processing filters for use with Java2D. The focus is mainly on visual effects rather than scientific uses or machine vision. To that end, the filters are designed to work mainly with ARGB BufferedImages. They are intended to be used where JAI would be overkill, such as in applets. Also included are a set of custom Composites which implement commonly-used blending modes.

Pending the writing of documentation, descriptions of the filters can be found  <a href="http://www.jhlabs.com/ip/filters">here</a>.
